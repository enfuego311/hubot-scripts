    'I simply don\'t like the culture of drugs. I never liked the hippies for it. I think it was a mistake to be all the time stoned and on weed. It didn\'t look right and it doesn\'t look right today either and the damage drugs have done to civilizations are too enormous. And besides, I don\'t need any drug to step out of myself. I don\'t want them and I do not need them.',
    'I am someone who takes everything very literally. I simply do not understand irony, a defect I have had ever since I was able to think independently.',
    'I find it interesting that there are impostors out on the Internet pretending to be Werner Herzog.',
    'Of course I do things in my voice in my commentary, which I wrote.',
    'I am so used to plunging into the unknown that any other surroundings and form of existence strike me as exotic and unsuitable for human beings.',
    'I think I would be a good villain in a James Bond movie.',
    'I have learned a lot through defeats, and, until today, it\'s - I\'m still haunted by defeats, and they do happen. Sometimes, a film of mine is rejected. And how do you deal with it? And you have to learn how to deal with it and survive anyway.',
    'The collapse of the stellar universe will occur - like creation - in grandiose splendor.',
    'I\'m very, very curious about how people live under the volcano, how they handle the permanence of danger.',
    'I see planets that don\'t exist and landscapes that have only been dreamed.',
    'You can\'t have a helicopter fly over boiling lava. It would\'ve exploded from the heat, and is just way too dangerous. The pilot of a helicopter would\'ve flatly refused anyway.',
    'I discover no kinship, no understanding, no mercy. I see only the overwhelming indifference of nature.',
    'I am a product of my failures.',
    'Life in the oceans must be sheer hell. A vast, merciless hell of permanent and immediate danger. So much of a hell that during evolution some species—including man—crawled, fled onto some small continents of solid land, where the Lessons of Darkness continue.',
    'You are confronted with abysses of time that are, in a way, unfathomable. You see a painting in charcoal of reindeer and it was left unfinished and somebody else finished it. But through radio carbon dating we know that the next one completed the painting 5,000 years later. You\'re just blown away by the notion of passage of time. We have no relationship to that kind of depth of time.',
    'The trees are in misery, and the birds are in misery. I don’t think they sing. They just screech in pain. …Taking a close look at what’s around us, there is some sort of harmony: it’s the harmony of overwhelming and collective murder.',
    'I would travel down to Hell and wrestle a film away from the devil if it was necessary.',
    'Someone like Jean-Luc Godard is for me intellectual counterfeit money when compared to a good kung fu film.',
    'Ambition is to be the fastest runner on this planet, to be the first on the South Pole, which is a grotesque perversion of ambition. It\'s an ego trip, and I\'m not on an ego trip. I don\'t have ambitions - I have a vision.',
    'I think psychology and self-reflection is one of the major catastrophes of the twentieth century.',
    'At the market I ate a piece of a grilled monkey—it looked like a naked child.',
    'In the evening I finished reading a book, and because I was feeling so alone, I buried the book on the edge of the forest with a borrowed spade.',
    'I despise formal restaurants. I find all of that formality to be very base and vile. I would much rather eat potato chips on the sidewalk.',
    'I\'m not an activist.',
    'I think there should be holy war against yoga classes.',
    'Life on our planet has been a constant series of cataclysmic events, and we are more suitable for extinction than a trilobite or a reptile. So we will vanish. There\'s no doubt in my heart.',
    'I think there are specific times where film noir is a natural concomitant of the mood. When there\'s insecurity, collapse of financial systems - that\'s where film noir always hits fertile ground.',
    'Civilization is like a thin layer of ice upon a deep ocean of chaos and darkness.',
    'I have dwelt among the humans. Their entire culture is built around their penises. It\'s funny to say they are small. It\'s funny to say they are big. I have been at parties, where humans have held bottles, pencils, thermoses in front of themselves, and called out, \'Hey, look at me! I\'m Mr. So-And-So Dick! I\'ve got such-and-such for a penis!\' I never saw it fail to get a laugh.',
    'I shouldn\'t make movies anymore. I should go to a lunatic asylum.',
    'You are all wrong.',
    'Meanwhile it\'s got stormy, the tattered fog even thicker, chasing across my path. Three people are sitting in a glassy tourist cafe between clouds and clouds, protected by glass from all sides. Since I don\'t see any waiters, it crosses my mind that corpses have been sitting there for weeks, statuesque. All this time the cafe has been unattended, for sure. Just how long have they been sitting here, petrified like this?',
    'I\'m quite convinced that cooking is the only alternative to film making. Maybe there\'s also another alternative, that\'s walking on foot.',
    'There are deeper strata of truth in cinema, and there is such a thing as poetic, ecstatic truth. It is mysterious and elusive, and can be reached only through fabrication and imagination and stylization.',
    'It is not only my dreams, my belief is that all these dreams are yours as well. The only distinction between me and you is that I can articulate them. And that is what poetry or painting or literature or filmmaking is all about... and it is my duty because this might be the inner chronicle of what we are. We have to articulate ourselves, otherwise we would be cows in the field.',
    'I believe the common denominator of the universe is not harmony; but chaos, hostility and murder.',
    'In the face of the obscene, explicit malice of the jungle, which lacks only dinosaurs as punctuation, I feel like a half-finished, poorly expressed sentence in a cheap novel.',
    'Look into the eyes of a chicken and you will see real stupidity. It is a kind of bottomless stupidity, a fiendish stupidity. They are the most horrifying, cannibalistic and nightmarish creatures in the world.',
    'Do you not then hear this horrible scream all around you that people usually call silence.',
    'Life is a battery of suffering before nonexistence overtakes all.',
    'Madness reigns. The first challenge your soul must endure is the parking lot. You wait with your vehicle half blocking traffic, creating a perfect circular vortex of anger that encompasses the street and the entrance to the store. Once you attain access to the lot, you discover that this is a false achievement; other motorists stop and start with no apparent thought or plan--- turns once begun are quickly abandoned, the drivers seemingly immune to geometry. At last a space opens up, but the price is having to enter the store. Inside, human beings scramble like beetles whose rock has been upended. Though the aisles are wide it is impossible to avoid physical contact with your fellow shoppers. It is a grotesque parody of the bazaar at Marrakech, as if dumb animals had been granted only the amount of sentience required to mock humanity. The aisles are not labeled. You must search for every item. The constant walking up and down causes a numbness that borders on profound despair. Your conscious mind registers merely annoyance, impatience. But on a cellular level, your body cries out in weariness. The fatigue you feel is a warning: millions of years of evolution trying to save you from becoming mired in the tar, from sinking into the warm blackness and ultimately being reclaimed by the earth itself. Be sure to get the dark chocolate peanut butter cups, they are right by the register.',
    'I lie awake atop the covers of my cruel bed in the absurdly cramped quarters I have procured at the Majestic Hotel. Sweat flows freely from my entire body, pooling under me and soaking the preposterous bag of air and stones that serves as the mattress. A clammy apprehension seizes me as I reach for the thermostat above the nightstand. Am I truly controlling anything? Certainly not the temperature. Mankind struggles always to convince itself that machines may give it sway over cold, over heat, but eventually the earth claims every creature, thinking or brainless, and all of us shall share the climate of nothingness. Through the thin wall I hear, in quick succession, the rustle of synthetic fabric, a cry of terror, and the unmistakable crack that signifies the breaking of a human toe.',
    'Why does the cow say moo? So that he might, for a brief moment, escape the unbearable scream that is silence.'
